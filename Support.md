Click on the Subway Stops tab and either scroll through all the subway stops or type in the name of the stop `72nd st` for example and select that stop.
You will know your stop is selected when you see the checkmark next to the stop.

Then you can leave the app open or close it and be notified. If the app is running in the background, the notification will pop up a little bit earlier than if you but if the app is open the phone will vibrate.

# If you have any questions or feature requests, you can upload them here in the issues section.
Enjoy the app! Sleep well.
